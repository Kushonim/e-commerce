# e-comsomnia-db
## Description
This is an application that utilizes the application Insomnia to operate all the necessary CRUD operations for a product database. The provided operations are to CREATE, READ/GET, UPDATE, and DELETE for any tags, products, and categories for each item. The application also allows for easy specific searches via ID's that also help with manipulating specific items. I took the time to work on this application to get some practice and a proper understanding of how Insomnia works and the live time changes to databases given CRUD operations.

## Installation & Demo
Simply download the files provided by the application's [repo](https://github.com/Kushonim/e-comsomnia-db) and/or follow along with the [demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OzlCOwlzraciStEscaAKdVkMwekzWA1s/view). If there is no video available, open the assets folder's integrated terminal and install all npm's and run npm start.

## Usage
This application serves as a practical example of database management using Insomnia. It allows you to perform all the essential CRUD operations—CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE—on tags, products, and categories within the product database. You can also execute specific searches using IDs to efficiently manage individual items. This project was developed to gain hands-on experience with Insomnia and to understand how real-time changes to databases occur through CRUD operations.
